To run JPeNS, merely checkout the project into a directory of your choice. Then open Eclipse and tell it to import an existing project into your workspace. Then select the directory that you downloaded JPeNS into and it should be imported into Eclipse. All you then need to do is browse to the JPeNS/src/master directory, open MainApp.java and run.
